INTRODUCTION

This project deals with working with and cleaning a data sets. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used
for later analysis. The source dataset used represents the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone full dataset. 

DATA SOURCE

The source data was obtained from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The subset of the data used for this analysis was obtained from the following address:
